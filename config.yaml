          <p><strong>Software engineering leadership, agentic AI, governance, and the developer inner loop.</strong></p>
          <p>I am a pragmatic Software Engineering Manager with over 15 years of experience building software in finance, banking, energy, compliance, and security. I build high‑performing teams by empowering developers, leading by example with a deep love for code, cloud, and automation to solve complex problems and foster operational excellence.</p>
          <p>I care deeply about developer experience, sustainable velocity, governance that doesn't suffocate creativity, and using AI responsibly to accelerate clarity—especially at the requirements stage where most delivery friction originates.</p>
          <p>When I'm not exploring new tech, I'm planning the next travel adventure with my family.</p>
