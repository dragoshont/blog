      I am a pragmatic Senior Engineering Manager who builds high-performing teams by empowering developers. Grounded in a deep love for writing code, cloud, and automation, I lead by example to solve complex problems and foster a culture of accountability and operational excellence. When I'm not exploring new tech, I'm planning the next travel adventure with my family.
