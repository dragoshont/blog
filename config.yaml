      I am a pragmatic Software Engineering Manager with over 15 years of experience building software in finance, banking, energy, compliance, and security.  I build high-performing teams by empowering developers, leading by example with a deep love for code, cloud, and automation to solve complex problems and foster operational excellence. When I'm not exploring new tech, I'm planning the next travel adventure with my family.
