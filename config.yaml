          <strong>Software engineering leadership, agentic AI, governance, and the developer inner loop.</strong><br/>
          I am a pragmatic Software Engineering Manager with over 15 years building software in finance, banking, energy, compliance, and security. I build high‑performing teams by empowering developers, leading by example with a deep love for code, cloud, and automation to solve complex problems and foster operational excellence. When I'm not exploring new tech, I'm planning the next travel adventure with my family.<br/><br/>
          Sharing pragmatic patterns from enterprise platforms & sovereign cloud. Recent posts below.
